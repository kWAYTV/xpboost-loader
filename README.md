# XPBOOST.LUA Loader, auto load and inject the accounts
Install SanboxiePlus<br />
I basically replaced vac bypass success windows by beeps to make it a procces *without* having to click annoying shit like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984877542529962054/985120358204076032/unknown.png).<br />
Place everything in a folder with **ONLY** the *template.bat* and the *skeet loader* (exe)<br /><br />
# Setting it up
Steps:<br />
**/box:name** with the name of each respective sandboxie box (one per account without main)<br />
**bot1_user bot1_pass** username password format (whith every one).<br />
**Steam path**<br />
**Sandboxie Path**<br />
**Vac bypass loader Path** preferable drop it in D: Drive root directory and don't edit the .bat default path<br /><br />
Main *doesn't* use sandboxie neither vac bypass<br />
Set up the *timeouts* according to your pc specs.<br /><br />
# How to add more bots
To add more bots add this code below line line 41 as much times as bots you want to add:<br />
