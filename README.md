# xpboost-loader
XPBOOST.LUA Loader, auto load and inject the accounts.
I basically replaced vac bypass success windows by beeps to make it a procces *without* having to click. Use sandboxie-plus.
Place everything in a folder with **ONLY** the *template.bat* and the *skeet loader* (exe)
Fill up the info like:
**/box:name** with the name of each respective sandboxie box (one per account without main)
**bot1_user bot1_pass** username password format (whith every one).
**Steam path**
**Sandboxie Path**
**Vac bypass loader Path**
Main *doesn't* use sandboxie neither vac bypass
Set up the *timeouts* according to your pc specs.
